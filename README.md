# Simple Code Magazine Blog

I built this web page using flexbox and grid with ReactJS, with a little dependency on the course by jonas : Udemy - Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS

At this point, it is not responsive. but I'm planning to make it so.

The page has use of most CSS basics, like selectors, pseudo-classes, pseudo-elements, positioning, font styling, coloring, relative units, grid layout and flexbox, etc...

here is an image of the blog:
